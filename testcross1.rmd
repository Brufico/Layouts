## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
kable(summary(cars))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed and reference plots, for example: plot <A HREF=#foo>Figure 1</A>, or plot <A HREF=#fee>Figure 2</A>  

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Hard Text, no auto num"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r foo, fig.cap = "<a name= foo></a> This is caption 1" }
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))+ geom_point()

```


```{r fee, fig.cap = "<a name= fee></a> This is caption 2" }
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg))+ geom_boxplot(aes(group=cyl))

```
