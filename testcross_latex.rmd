## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 


## Including Plots

You can also embed and reference plots, for example: plot <A HREF=#fig:foo>Figure 1</A>, or plot <A HREF=#fee>Figure 2</A>  and at last <A HREF=#faa>Figure 3</A>

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Hard Text, no auto num"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r foo, fig.cap = "<a name= fig:foo></a> This is caption 1" }
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))+ geom_point()

```


```{r fee, fig.cap = "<a name= fee></a> This is caption 2" }
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl, mpg))+ geom_boxplot(aes(group=cyl))

```

Some more text to separate items the, a ast plot

```{r chunkfaa, fig.cap = "<a name= faa></a> This is caption 3" }
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg))+ geom_point(aes(color=factor(cyl)))

```

## tables:

You can have tables like this:

```{r mtcars}
kable(head(mtcars[, 1:5]), caption = "\\label{tab:mtcars}This is the 'mtcars' `kable` table caption1")
```




```{r cars}
kable(summary(cars), caption = "\\label{tab:cars}This is the 'cars' `kable` table 2")
```


an you can also reference figures again: plot <A HREF=#fig:foo>Figure 1</A>, or plot <A HREF=#fee>Figure 2</A>  and at last <A HREF=#faa>Figure 3</A>

And some text to finish: Goodbye!
